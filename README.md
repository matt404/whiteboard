This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### Docker Usage

To build the docker container:

```dockerfile
docker build -t matt404/whiteboard .
```

To run the application in a local docker container:

```dockerfile
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 matt404/whiteboard
```


Check the container status

```dockerfile
docker ps
```

To stop the container: (use the command above to get the container id)

```dockerfile
docker stop <container id>
```

Attach to a container with new terminal session:

```dockerfile
docker exec -i -t <container id> /bin/bash
```

You can remove dangling Docker images by running:

```dockerfile
docker rmi -f $(docker images -qf dangling=true)
```

To download and start the application from a fresh Docker host:

```dockerfile
docker pull pull matt404/whiteboard

docker run -d --name whiteboard -p 3000:3000 matt404/whiteboard
```

To publish the docker image to docker hub:

```dockerfile
docker push matt404/whiteboard
```
